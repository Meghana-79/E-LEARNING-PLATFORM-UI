TASK-4

To design the front-end for an E-learning platform with course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding, we can use React.js for dynamic UI, TailwindCSS for quick and modern styling, and React Router for multi-page navigation. The platform will include a Home page with featured courses, an Explore Courses page with searchable and filterable course cards, a Course Details page with embedded videos and module lists, and a User Dashboard to track learning progress with visual progress bars. The design style will feature clean typography, soft shadows, rounded corners, and a calm color palette (Indigo, Cyan, Light Gray). Components like CourseCard, VideoPlayer, and ProgressBar will be reusable, responsive, and animated using Framer Motion for smooth UX. The directory structure will organize components and pages clearly, ensuring maintainability. Overall, the interface will be interactive, visually appealing, and fully responsive across devices.
